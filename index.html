Hello !  My name is Garima Sharma and welcome to my website. Many NCEA students in New Zealand Secondary Schools struggle with coping with immense  loads of study, assessments  and assignments. During this time such students  lack study efficiency   and the skill of  how to organize  the study which you conduct. Therefore  which is why I have  created this website called Study Point. Which aims to provide resources and information  for students who want to improve their study skills and their efficiency  in studying their respective subjects  as  NCEA High School Students.
